This is my Task manager web application. This task manager opens up a webpage that contains a task manager that allows the user to create and add tasks,
complete tasks, as well as remove tasks. The Task manager was created using Python Flask, HTML, and using the library Jinja2. I started by creating a base
code for opening the webpage using Python. Secondly, I created a CSS file for class specifications on the HTML files needes for implementation of design.
After that, I made index and other HTML files for the sake of avoiding rewriting code needlessly, as well
as cleaning up the webpage for a simple and minimalistic design. After all, the task manager is meant to make it easy for the user to manage their tasks.
Once that was done, I created my database and made add and remove task commands, adding and removing from the database according to the user's needs.
The task manager contained two pages; one for adding tasks, and one for viewing and managing them. I created the page for managing in order to make the
style of the task manager less clumped and crowded. All in all, this task manager was a great way to learn the basics of back end coding such as databases 
and the use of multiple webpages and corresponding commands. Thank you for reading.
